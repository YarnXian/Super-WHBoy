Project Introduction
-
###I believe that many netizens have experienced the panda burning virus incident in 2007. Although the virus is no surprise at present, we have recently rewritten a panda incense burner and named it "Super WHBoy"
###It is written in easy language.
###There are two files: self starting.e is the program after the virus is added and started; main.e is the main body of the program, which runs only once.
###Virus behavior: 1. Release self boot file and icon file in the root directory of the system; 2. Modify the registry to change the default icon of EXE file to the icon file released under the root directory; 3. Destroy the opening mode of some files so that they cannot be opened; 4. Shut down the computer after 10 minutes; 5. Open a web page every 18 seconds; 6. Close CMD, tasklist and regedit every 1 second; 6. Destroy the hard disk host Boot record.
